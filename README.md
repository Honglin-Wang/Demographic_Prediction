# Demographic_Prediction

## Objectives 
to build a model predicting usersâ€™ demographic characteristics based on their app usage, geolocation, and mobile device properties. Doing so will help millions of developers and brand advertisers around the world pursue data-driven marketing efforts which are relevant to their users and catered to their preferences.

## File descriptions (just sample data, the full data is too big)
